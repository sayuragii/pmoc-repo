<h1>Hello, stranger!</h1>
<p>This is a website in which I gather and archive as many resources as possible to help people who are interested in making PM OCs. I will try to update this as I find or I'm sent more things, but don't expect it to be 100% ! I can only do so much. There will be things like picrew/neka makers, code snippets for TH, google docs, randomizers, and other things!</p>
<p>Each category is separated by game, however I will treat the Library of Ruina (LOR) section like it's a general city section as well as focusing on library nuggets if applicable. Generally, think of it like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lobcorp - Agent/Nuggets, Abno things, etc.</li>
    <li>LoR - General Cityfolk like fixers, wing employees, civilians, etc.</li>
    <li>Limbus - Sinners or other Limbus Employees (but this will mostly focus on sinners. Sorry, LCC / LCD guys.)</li>
    <li>General - Things that aren't fandom specific OR don't fall under any specific game category.</li>
  </ul>

<p>I think everyone should have equal chances at having amazing OCs, so I hope this site helps people put love into their characters and make a culture in which we all have so many cool things to share. In my early days of sharing my characters, often I'd be asked things like "Where did you find this?" or "How did you do this?," which honestly becomes a bit tiring to answer over and over or to search for the things i used, so now I can just send a link and throw someone into the playground.</p>

<h1>8.11.24</h1>
<p>This is the first iteration of this website. As of right now, I just added things that I remember finding.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions, or you're the creator of some resource and you want it taken down, my email is utsusemi@sayuragi.com, my discord is @vogelnotes, and my twitter is @sayuragii. Feel free to shoot me a message and I'll do my best to assist you. Additionally, if you want a toyhouse code, feel free to contact me. I got you :)</p>

I love OCs and I love Project Moon's works, if you can't tell. I have around 40 OCs in total, but I mostly focus on a few of my main 6 sinners. I also was the head moderator for the Children of the City zine, which focuses on showcasing a TON of OCs that were made within this beautiful world. You can find me on twitter @sayuragii. </p>
